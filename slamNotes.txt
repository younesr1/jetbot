SLAM Types: 
    Probablistic SLAM: p(x,m|z,u) where {desired: {x: robot path, m: map}, given: {z: observations, u: controls/inputs}}

    Full SLAM: estimates entire path

    Online SLAM: Recovers only the most recent pose

    Volumetric SLAM: 3D representation of physical structure

    Monocular SLAM: Using only camera for SLAM

    Feature based SLAM: Attempts to represent distinct landmarks

Approach:
1. Detect features across frames using opencv orb features
    first, get u,v location of orbs, then circle them in the img
